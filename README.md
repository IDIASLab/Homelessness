# Introduction
This repository provides the full code and results for the manuscript titled "Peeking Through the Homelessness System with a Network Science Lens" by Charalampos Chelmis and Khandker Sadia Rahman.

## Quick Overview
We computationally analyze a one of a kind individual-level longitudinal homelessness dataset to further our understanding of how individuals progress through the homelessness system with the ultimate goal of securing stable housing. We model the homelessness system as a network of interconnected services which individuals traverse over time and we formalize the concept of stability upon exit of the system. We show that regardless of starting conditions, the ultimate goal is either reached quickly or not at all, indicating the importance of addressing the homelessâ€™ needs early on to avoid them "giving up". Next, we formalize similarity between homeless services inspired by a view of the homelessness system as a heterogeneous network. We show that in its current form the homelessness system is inefficient in promoting trajectories towards positive outcomes.
